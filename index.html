<h1>Hi, I'm Jen!</h1>

<p> I love exploring France on the weekends! I launched a blog with a friend to share my weekend adventures!

<h2>Hiking</h2>
<p>
	I think hiking is one of the best ways to relax and enjoy nature.
	</p>


<h2>Eating</h2>
<p>
	In French we use the word "gourmandise" to describe the appreciation of good food (sometimes to excess, oops!). I love to share about food that brings me joy!
	</p>


	<h2>Connecting locally</h2>
<p>
	One of the beautiful parts of moving to France was the ability to travel but to do it locally. Whenever possible I connect with the people around to understand what they find beautiful about where they come from.
